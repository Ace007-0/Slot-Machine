# Slot Machine Simulation

This Python code simulates a simple slot machine game. The player can deposit money, choose the number of lines to bet on, and the bet amount for each line. The slot machine will then randomly generate a set of symbols for each line and determine the winnings based on matching symbols on the same line.

Here's a general overview of the code:

Constants:

MAX_LINES: The maximum number of lines the player can bet on.
MAX_BET: The maximum bet amount the player can place on a single line.
MIN_BET: The minimum bet amount the player can place on a single line.
ROWS and COLS: The number of rows and columns for the slot machine.
symbol_count and symbol_value dictionaries:

symbol_count: Specifies the count of each symbol in the slot machine.
symbol_value: Assigns a value to each symbol, which will be used to calculate winnings.
Functions:

check_winnings(columns, lines, bet, values): Checks for winning combinations and calculates the winnings based on the symbols matched on each line.
get_slot_machine_spin(rows, cols, symbols): Generates a random spin for the slot machine with the given number of rows and columns using the provided symbols and their counts.
print_slot_machine(columns): Displays the current state of the slot machine with its symbols.
deposit(): Takes the player's initial deposit for the game.
get_no_of_lines(): Asks the player to choose the number of lines to bet on.
get_bet(): Asks the player to choose the bet amount for each line.
spin(balance): Executes a single spin of the slot machine, calculates the winnings, and updates the player's balance accordingly.
The main() function:

Initiates the game by asking the player to deposit an initial amount.
Repeatedly prompts the player to press Enter to play a round or 'q' to quit.
Calls the spin() function to perform a single spin and update the balance.
The game continues until the player chooses to quit.

Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of a slot machine game using Python.
